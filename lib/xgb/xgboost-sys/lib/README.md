## Content
This folder contains binary shared libraries of version 3.0.0 of xgboost.
The libs are not needed if feature "use_prebuilt_xgb" is disabled.

They have been uploaded here for convenience and because homebrew isn't able to download a specific version. 
The selection was made internally for our developers - we currently don't need to add other binaries. There probably is no GPU support.
